	What was the very first cell phone availible to the public?
	</h2>
	<p class="info indexbody">
	The Motorola DynaTAC 8000x. It was a crazy new idea that you could take a phone with you wherever you went. But being the first of its kind, it was very bulky, weighing in at 1.75 lbs. It was also very expensive, costing customers to pay $4,000 at launch (Worth about $10,400 now).
